================
- Almost all of the GUI code was blatantly stolen from XMMS's
  equalizer code with some modifications
- The autoconf stuff was based on xmms-crossfade's own
- The look of the GUI was taken from the Panic skin.
  by Xcs
- The application note from Motorola 'DSP based 10-Band equalizer'
  has a lot of interesting information about designing pass band
  filters, etc.
  Although some of the math they do on the application note had errors, 
  it was still pretty useful.

- Used the Echo plugin as a template for starting this plugin
- The benchmark code was taken from Randal E. Bryant lectures on Introduction
  to Computer Systems at CMU. The lecture material seems to be widely used
  at universities in USA (found copies in several CS websites)
