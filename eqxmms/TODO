- -Almost DONE- Clean up the code
- -DONE- Wherever is possible, use code from the XMMS equalizer GUI directly,
  instead of the copy
- -DONE- Create a configure GUI to select the following options
  (currently only changeable by rerunning configure and recompiling)
   * Use independent settings for each channel (left-right)
   * Select the number of bands
- Add to configure GUI
   * -DONE- (Maybe) If the user wants to use less CPU use only one of the
     two stages of the filter with the side effect of less boost
	 in the eq output
   * -DONE- When using independent channels, turn on/off slider lock.
- Last but not least:
	* Faster implementation of the filters
	  MMX, SSE, 3DNow! support?
- Use the preamp value to really preamp
- -DONE- Support skins?
- Implement the filters in the frequency domain?
- Make this a sort of universal EQ (i.e. something that can be
  between any application using the sound card and
- Support more of the audio formats used by XMMS, not just 16bit signed
- Test on *BSD on x86 and on other platforms supported by XMMS
- Create RPMs and binaries
- Have a 'shade' mode for the GUI (like that in XMMS)
- Be able to change the central frequencies dynamically as well as the
  bandwidth?
- Calculate the real gain in dB per band and modify the GUI and the sliders
  to reflect this
