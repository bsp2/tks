`Eureka` is Synergy's DAW companion app that serves as a **sampler** (with support for per-voice plugins (FX + synthesis), (additive) wavetables (incl. resynthesis) and live-recording / monophonic realtime polyphonization), a **sample editor** (with support for [SoX](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sox/), [Rubberband](https://rubberbandaudio.com/) and [MPG123](https://www.mpg123.de/)), a multitrack **mixer** and **recorder**, a polyphonic **modular synthesizer** (with support for native code generation), and a **plugin host** (CLAP, VST2, STFX). It connects with `Synergy` either via high-speed shared memory, or any other MIDI transports.
