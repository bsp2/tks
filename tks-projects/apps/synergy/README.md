`Synergy` is a free and open source (semi-)modular MIDI sequencer, patch editor and event processor / router, available for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

It is designed as a **performance sequencer** that supports extensive realtime sequence modulations and live arrangements of patterns and clips, all of which can be recorded back to new sequences for further editing and / or (live-)recording passes.
