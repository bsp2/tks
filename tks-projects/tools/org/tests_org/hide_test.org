; this is an example for hiding sub-trees from export and/or scheduler


========================================================
* Everything

........................................................
** Task 1
   > fold: sub tasks will contribute to effort but won't be listed as separate tasks in schedule
   > sub-tasks will always be exported to .org files
   allocate: peter
   fold
   - detail task 1.1 (2d)
   - detail task 1.2 (3d)    
   - detail task 1.3 (7d)
   ? undecided tasks
      > everything below tasks with states other than <none>,TODO,ACTV,TEST,DONE will be ignored by scheduler
      - task 1.4 (101d)
      - task 1.5 (102d)

........................................................
** Task 2
   > private: sub tasks will contribute to effort but won't be listed as separate tasks in schedule
   > sub-tasks will *NOT* be exported to .org files when -p,--private cmdline option is used
   allocate: paul
   private
   - detail task 2.1 (1d)
   - detail task 2.2 (5d)    
   - detail task 2.3 (3d)
   x canceled task 2.4 (100d)
   X ignored task 2.5 (1000d)

*** brainstorming in progress
    ignore
    - either this way (5d)
       ! don't have to delay the release
    - or that way (9d)
       ! might be better in the long run

** Task 3
   allocate: mary
   fold
   - detail task 3.1 (2d)
   - detail task 3.2 (4d)    
   - detail task 3.3 (1d)       

*** some unspecified private tasks
    > ignore: sub-tasks will not contribute to total effort
    > they will be exported to .org files unless combined with 'private'
     private
     ignore

     - not quite sure what to do here 3.4.1
        effort: 100d

     - are we really going to do this ?
        effort: 200d

     - customer said they probably won't need this
        effort: 500d
