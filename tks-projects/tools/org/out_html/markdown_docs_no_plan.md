# Introduction
This text will be converted to markdown, and then be appended to the exported HTML project plan document. 

*Info nodes*, i.e. all `INFO` (`!`) nodes that occur before the first task node, can be used to outline a project (project goals etc). 

The text in the *task nodes* can be used to describe each task, so the resulting document becomes a mixture between a project plan and a technical proposal. 

For highly detailed task descriptions it is recommended to link to additional, external documents. 


# Project goals
The goal of this project is to serve as a debugging test case.


# Requirements
Identify the requirements in detail and subdivide existing tasks into smaller, more manageable tasks.


# Specification
Once the requirements are known, devise a technical approach and specify the implementation details (architectural overview, block diagrams, ..). 

This includes updates to the `.org` files, and possibly the creation of additional technical documents. 


# Implementation
