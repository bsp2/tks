      - 183 sources
      - 203 destinations
      - log / lin / exp curve per entry
      - slew per entry
         - can also be used to generate attack / decay mini-envelopes
      - 4 scratch registers
      - 13 op modes per entry (add, mul, replace, blend, compare, step, ..)
      - support for 14 bit hi-res continuous controllers (CCs)
         - modwheel (CC#1), breath control (CC#2), foot control (CC#4), expression (CC#11)
   - arbitrary number of zones (layers) per sample
      - mono or stereo
      - note, velocity, modulation (e.g. modwheel) filters
      - "alt" groups
      - "mutex" groups
   - up to 32 voice buses
      - for routing audio between sample zones
      - sample zone cross modulation (RM, AM, FM, ..)
   - arbitrary number of sample loops per zone
      - pitch or time based number of repeats
      - oneshot, forward, backward, pingpong, xfade loop modes
      - loops can be selected and switched via MIDI and mod matrix
   - monophonic and polyphonic glide
      - time or pitch based

      - time, note on, note off, mod rise / fall / edge / zcross step modes
      - up to 16 patterns, selectable via MIDI / mod matrix
   - MIDI or threshold triggered sampling
      - polyphonization of monophonic (oscillator) sound sources
         - update rate is ~300Hz
   - sample start and loop point modulation
      - random, velocity-based, and / or mod matrix controlled
   - voice calibration tables
      - for (subtle) voice modulation
